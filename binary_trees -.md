#Binary Trees

    Binary trees are like linked lists in the way that they are nodes that are linked. But, with binary

     trees, there is a root or a parent node and this node can be linked to 2 different nodes which are 

     child nodes, those can then be linked to 2 more node each and so on and so forth. 

     The Big O notation is log(n) because it can rule out half of the information each time it searches.
    
     Because the smaller value is always on the left and the bigger value on the right.


     To find a value in a binary tree, it might helo to use recursion, because it will cut the 
     
     information in half and then go through it again and again while it gets smaller and smaller until 
     
     it finds the correct value.
